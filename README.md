# AIT-CG-3D-Ray-Tracing

## This project is a **work in progress**

Implement a real-time ray tracer depicting a 3D winter holiday scene with realistic lighting. Created as a second milestone of the 3D project for my Computer Graphics course at the Aquincum Instute of Technology the fall of 2019 with professor László Szécsi.

One should be able to download the [3D_ray_tracing]() folder and open up the [index.html]() file in a web browser to see the project. To navigate the scene one can use the WASD keys to move around as well as click down and drag the mouse to change the camera's orientation. In the case of google chrome, one might have to open the browser with `open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files` in order to load images and textures properly. This project was built upon László Szécsi's starter code and class powerpoint slides.
